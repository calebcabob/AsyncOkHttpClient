Pull Requests
---
    Well if you is seeing this and wanna contribute is a good point, all pull request are welcome :+1: but before submit any pull request please review your code and test it, all pull requests will be tested by me, and think in a real use case for the pull request, I **will not** merge a pull request without a motive.
    But if this ok I have some roles and you need follow them, basically is the Android team code style with some adaptations is really easy let's see:
    
1. Line tab identation is 4 spaces
2. Line continuation is 8 spaces
3. Prefrer the <code>foreach</code> statment before normal <code>for</code>

If statments:
**Correct**
```
if(1 == 1) {
    //code
}

if(1 == 1) System.out.println("This if is ok")
```
